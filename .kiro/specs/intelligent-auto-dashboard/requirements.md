# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement will remove the chat functionality from the AI Dashboard application while maintaining the automatic analysis and PowerBI-style dashboard generation capabilities.

6. IF categorical data exists THEN the system SHALL generate bar charts, pie charts, and treemaps

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Data Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a business executive, I want the system to automatically identify key data patterns, correlations, and business insights, so that I can focus on strategic decisions rather than data exploration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing data THEN the system SHALL identify statistical correlations above 0.5 significance
2. WHEN patterns are found THEN the system SHALL categorize them as trends, seasonality, or anomalies
3. WHEN business metrics are detected THEN the system SHALL calculate relevant KPIs automatically
4. WHEN data quality issues exist THEN the system SHALL highlight and quantify them
5. IF revenue/sales data is present THEN the system SHALL perform financial analysis
6. IF customer data is present THEN the system SHALL perform segmentation analysis

### Requirement 4: Dynamic PowerBI-Style Layout

**User Story:** As a dashboard consumer, I want the generated dashboard to have a professional PowerBI-style layout with multiple panels and interactive elements, so that I can explore data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying dashboards THEN the system SHALL use a multi-panel grid layout
2. WHEN creating layouts THEN the system SHALL include KPI cards at the top
3. WHEN arranging charts THEN the system SHALL prioritize high-impact visualizations prominently
4. WHEN generating colors THEN the system SHALL use professional business color schemes
5. IF screen space allows THEN the system SHALL display 4-6 charts simultaneously
6. IF data supports it THEN the system SHALL include interactive filtering capabilities

### Requirement 5: Contextual Business Insights

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want the system to provide contextual insights and recommendations based on the data analysis, so that I can understand what actions to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate 3-5 key business insights
2. WHEN insights are generated THEN they SHALL be specific to the detected business domain
3. WHEN recommendations are provided THEN they SHALL be actionable and measurable
4. WHEN anomalies are found THEN the system SHALL explain their potential business impact
5. IF growth opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL quantify the potential value
6. IF risks are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest mitigation strategies

### Requirement 6: Code Generation and Execution Framework

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI agents to safely generate and execute Python visualization code, so that charts are created dynamically while maintaining system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL use secure code execution environments
2. WHEN executing code THEN the system SHALL validate all generated code before execution
3. WHEN code fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback visualizations
4. WHEN libraries are used THEN the system SHALL only use approved visualization libraries
5. IF code generation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and use template charts
6. IF memory limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL optimize chart complexity automatically

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the automatic dashboard generation to be fast and handle large datasets efficiently, so that I can work with real-world business data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing datasets up to 10MB THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 30 seconds
2. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL use data sampling for visualization
3. WHEN generating multiple charts THEN the system SHALL use parallel processing
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection
5. IF processing takes longer than 60 seconds THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
6. IF datasets exceed limits THEN the system SHALL provide data reduction suggestions

### Requirement 8: Enhanced User Experience

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the automatic dashboard experience to be smooth, informative, and visually appealing, so that I can focus on insights rather than technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading data THEN the system SHALL show intelligent loading messages
2. WHEN analysis is running THEN the system SHALL display progress with estimated completion time
3. WHEN dashboards are ready THEN the system SHALL highlight the most important insights
4. WHEN charts are displayed THEN they SHALL include hover tooltips and interactive elements
5. IF analysis reveals issues THEN the system SHALL explain them in business terms
6. IF multiple views are available THEN the system SHALL provide easy navigation between them

### Requirement 9: Enhanced Chat Agent with Graph Generation

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the chat agent to generate graphs and visualizations based on my questions, so that I can get immediate visual insights through natural language queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask about data patterns THEN the chat agent SHALL generate appropriate visualizations
2. WHEN I request specific chart types THEN the system SHALL create matplotlib/plotly graphs
